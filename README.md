# citizen_firearms_safety
A firearms safety course, suitable for the full citizens of a free State, licensed under the Creative Commons - Attributions-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND) license.

Despite the dubious nature of licensing systems, to be a most introvertibly upstanding citizen, you may wish to participate in your State's licensing system. Many of those systems have a requirement of having completed a firearms safety course. However, we have noted that there are States where there are few or no such course completely free and readily available courses, and, contrarily, there are commercial incentives to limit access to the materials and licensure.

Other weaknesses in existing courses include:

* Historical accretions and disproportionate focus that have limited or niche value today
* Teaching methods that do not necessarily comport with current understanding, pace, or focus
* Extrinisic required material(s) that are not necessary or appropriate to the goal of the course, such as sitting through marketing propaganda (I'm looking at you, NRA -JRP)

This project will attempt to address those lacuna. Other positive things this course intends to do:

* Delineat and convey separately principles (the underlying truth), prudential considerations (the means to attain the ends), and actual practice (what people actually do), in order to give a more complete picture to the student.
* Clarify the principles under which citizens of a State established by a free People operate, including their rights and duties.
* Give a reason for the practices, to further aid understanding, including both desirable and contrary examples, and risks.
* Form individuals who will be safe, effective, and free life-long citzen-students who are capable of being teachers of what they know.


While the project is licensed as CC BY-ND (to avoid having competing and ever-shifting courses for the purposes of State accreditation of the course), and will undergo minimal releases, we welcome criticism and additions and permit derivatives stored as push requests in GIT for the purpose of suggesting alternative text.
